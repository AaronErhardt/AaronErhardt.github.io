Roughly one month after the first stable release a I'm happy to announce the second stable release of Relm4! üöÄüöÄüöÄ

## About Relm4

We believe that GUI development should be easy, productive and delightful.  
The [gtk4-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs) crate already provides everything you need to write modern, beautiful and cross-platform applications. Built on top of this foundation, Relm4 makes developing more idiomatic, simpler and faster and enables you to become productive in just a few hours.

### What's new?

Overall there have been a lot of fixes and improvements, most importantly:

+ Better error messages in the widget macro

+ Widgets and components are now always added in the correct order by the widget macro ([#20](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/issues/20))

+ Reusable components can now be used multiple times in the same application (thanks to [mskorkowski](https://github.com/mskorkowski))

+ Factories were reworked to better handle TabViews in libadwaita

The full change log can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/blob/main/CHANGES.md). Even though there are a few breaking changes, existing projects should be able to update with no or only minor changes. 

## Where to get started

Relm4 has an outstanding documentation. The official book covers every aspect of Relm4 and is made for everyone from beginners to experts. Also, there a lots of examples that can be found in the repository.
