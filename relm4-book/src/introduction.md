# About

Relm4 is an idiomatic GUI library inspired by [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and based on [gtk4-rs](https://crates.io/crates/gtk4). 
It is a new version of [relm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm) that's built from scratch and is compatible with [GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/).


## Goals

+ ‚è±Ô∏è **Productivity:** Writing an application should require as few overhead as possible
+ ‚ö° **Flexibility:** Anything that's possible to do with GTK4 should be possible in Relm4 as well
+ ‚ú® **Simplicity:** Writing an application should be as easy and straight forward as possible
+ üîß **Maintainability**: The Elm programming model used by Relm4 provides a simple and clear structure for app development


## Platform support

All platforms supported by GTK4 are available for Relm4 as well:

+ Linux
+ Windows
+ MacOS

## Dependencies

I can recommend reading the [gtk4-rs book](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/book/) for getting more insight into development with GTK4. Yet, knowledge of GTK4 is not required for this book.

# Special thanks

I want to thank all contributors of [relm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm) especially [antoyo](https://github.com/antoyo) for building relm that inspired much of the work on Relm4.

Also, I want to thank all contributors of [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) that put a lot of effort into the project for creating outstanding Rust bindings for GTK4.

I want to thank [tronta](https://github.com/tronta) for contributing a lot of improvements to this book.
