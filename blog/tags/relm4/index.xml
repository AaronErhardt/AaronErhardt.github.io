About Relm4 Relm4 is an idiomatic GUI library inspired by Elm and based on gtk4-rs.
We believe that GUI development should be easy, productive and delightful.

About Relm4 Relm4 is an idiomatic GUI library inspired by Elm and based on gtk4-rs. It is a new version of relm that&amp;rsquo;s built from scratch and is compatible with GTK4 and libadwaita. The main goals are productivity, flexibility, simplicity and maintainability.
Over the last beta releases, the development slowly calmed down up to a point where I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable releasing the first stable version.</description></item><item><title>Relm4 beta released ðŸŽ‰</title><link>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/relm_beta/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +3000</pubDate><guid>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/relm_beta/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s relm? Relm is described on its repository as an &amp;ldquo;idiomatic, GTK+-based, GUI library, inspired by Elm, written in Rust&amp;rdquo; and has more than 2000 GitHub stars and over 36.000 downloads on crates.io.
When I first started with GUI development in Rust and experimented with gtk-rs I had a rough time because I was completely new to GUI development and GTK. Relm on the other side provided me the examples and structure I needed to get productive in just a couple of hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
