He was thinking about buying a laptop to replace his aging Microsoft Surface device.
He also expressed interest in trying Linux and asked specifically which laptop I was using.
So I said: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a laptop made by TUXEDO Computers.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty cool because the company is located here in Augsburg
and they even sponsor our Formula Student team.
They ship laptops with Linux pre-installed if you want.
Also, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a discount as a student.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing tuxedo-rs</title><link>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/announcing_tuxedo_rs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/announcing_tuxedo_rs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce &lt;a href="https://github.com/AaronErhardt/tuxedo-rs">tuxedo-rs&lt;/a>, a collection of Rust crates for interacting with hardware from TUXEDO Computers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/">TUXEDO Computers&lt;/a> is a PC and notebook vendor from Germany that sells hardware optimized for Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>TUXEDO Computers are customizable Linux notebooks and Desktop PCs optimized in the first place to run with Ubuntu-based Linux operating systems.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>Literally Linux hardware in a tailor-made suit.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat!
For me, having a small local hardware vendor that focuses on Linux is basically all I could wish for.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
