The maintainer of plotters did respond and fortunately all plans for forking the project are dropped.
Now all repositories live in the plotters-rs organization and can be maintained by members of the community. Also, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for people who want to join the maintenance team (#345).
What can we learn from this? Open source projects often start as personal projects.</description></item><item><title>Planning the future of plotters</title><link>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/plotters_future/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaronerhardt.github.io/blog/posts/plotters_future/</guid><description>With over 1900 stars on GitHub and over 600.000 downloads per month, plotters is a very prominent and widely used Rust crate. By a huge margin it is the most used plotting library for Rust and covers a lot of different use-cases and back-ends.
Yet, since roughly June 2021, almost 10 months ago, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any considerable activity on the main branch of the repository. At the same time, the community has been very active with 22 pull requests submitted since then, but none of them was reviewed or merged.</description></item></channel></rss>
